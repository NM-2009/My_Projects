    <p class="paralax"> My favorite part about reading is probably that we get to learn a lot of different stuff when we read. Like when we read historical books we learn more about what happened in the past. Also, it makes our creativity flow more. My favorite book is probably Harry potter and The Sorcers Stone or Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. It is really hard to decide which one is better since I really like them both!

    In my freetime, when I am not in school or playing games with my friends, I like to read books. Right now I am reading The Narnia Chronicles. The book series has 7 books and currently I am on book 4.
